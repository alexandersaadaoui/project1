## Live Demo

https://alexandersaadaoui.github.io/project1/index.html

## Project Overview

- The purpose of the project is to express the strange hostility of reality TV, where the funny questions become morality tests.
- The story is about how the player, Jack, is exposed for his bad deeds, and has to admit in the end that he is a bad person to earn the $100,000.

## Figma Design

## Features

- List the key features of the project, including:
    - **Animations**: I used CSS transitions to change the colors when you hover the buttons. I also used a gif for one of the pages.
    - **Sound Effects**: The start and ending pages all have an "Audience" button to play into the corny reality TV show setting. Of note, the audience applause is meant to contrast with the horrible questions/answer in the main ending.
    - **User-triggered Events**: Every page has one to three buttons, each that change color when you hover, and change to a new page or play audio when you press the button.
    - **Responsive Design**: The page is viewable on mobile devices without affecting the text, buttons, and images. The background fills the screen size.

## Technologies Used

- List the technologies and tools used in the project:
    - **Languages**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
    - **Other**: GitHub Pages for hosting, Figma for design

## Credits

- Windows95 font is from arnesava.com, images from shutterstock and VectorShock, images edited in 8bitworkshop.com, audio is from pixabay.com, audio is edited in websim.com.
- "Learn HTML in 1 hour" by Bro Code on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/HD13eq_Pmp8?si=MHDKmEBOdBhggS5d)

## Future Enhancements

- I would have liked to use sound effects for pressing the buttons, implement a score system, using animations for the host and player, and having "Correct" screens with autoplay audience cheering.
